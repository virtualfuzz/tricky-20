# tricky-20

This project is still under the demo/showcase phase, and
[I still have some things planned for it](TODO.md).

Tricky 20 is my attempt at making some kind of game that is playable though the
command line.

It's basically a bunch of puzzles that are fetchable though an API and can
mostly be done using the command line.

There are other repositories/content that is made for tricky-20 that isn't in
this repo, but they are also made for tricky-20 specifically (expect for one
blog post).

You can
[get more information and play it here](https://tricky.jayden295.hackclub.app)

## Screenshots

These aren't much, since this game is mostly played though the command line.

## Development/Running it

First, you need to have a .env file (that you must **KEEP PRIVATE**), or these
variables defined in your environment.

```env
AUTH_SECRET= # for auth.js create a bunch of random characters and that's it
AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL= # database url, postgresql recommanded
AUTH_GITHUB_ID= # github oauth client id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET= # github oauth client secret
AUTH_GITLAB_ID= # gitlab oauth client id
AUTH_GITLAB_SECRET= # gitlab oauth secret id
```

Then, install the project dependencies though `deno install`

Setup the database by running `deno task drizzle-kit generate` and
`deno task drizzle-kit migrate`

### Development

For development, simply run `deno task dev`.

### Production

For production, run `npm run build` and `deno task preview`.

For building, you need to use npm, unfortunately astro/deno don't work very well
together, I had build failures with deno.

By default, we build it using the node.js backend as a standalone build.\
You will probably need to add HOST=0.0.0.0 for it to work.\
[Official Astro documentation for node.js builds](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#standalone)

Other backends may work as well, but aren't not tested.
